### How to set up moderators?
1) Go to Config/config.json in the directory you extracted Reboot Backend into.
2) Open it, you should see a "moderators" section in the file.
3) You have to get your discord id and replace discordId with it.
4) You can set multiple moderators like this `["discordId","discordId2"]`.

## How to start Reboot Backend
1) Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).
2) Download and Extract Reboot Backend to a safe location.
3) Run "install_packages.bat" to install all the required modules.
4) Go to Config/config.json in the directory you extracted Reboot Backend into.
5) Open it, set your discord bot token (DO NOT SHARE THIS TOKEN) and save it. The discord bot will be used for creating accounts and managing your account (You can disable the discord bot by entering "bUseDiscordBot" to false in "Config/config.json").
6) Run "start.bat", if there is no errors, it should work.
7) Use something to redirect the Fortnite servers to localhost:8080 (Which could be fiddler, ssl bypass that redirects servers, etc...)
8) When Fortnite launches and is connected to the backend, enter your email and password (or launch with an exchange code) then press login. It should let you in and everything should be working fine.
